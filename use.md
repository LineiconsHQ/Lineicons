# Lineicons - Free Essential Icons for Designers and Developers

Lineicons offers a comprehensive icon library and pack ideal for designers and developers seeking free essential icons. Our free basic version provides 600+ high-quality line-style icons, available for use in any commercial or personal projects without requiring attribution.

## Installation

You can easily install Lineicons as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lineicons).

```bash
npm install lineicons
```

Alternatively, you can use Yarn:

```bash
yarn add lineicons
```

## Usage

### Using CSS

To use Lineicons with CSS, simply reference the CSS file in your project. Insert the `lineicons.css` file within the `<head>` tag as shown below:

```html
<head>
  <link href="/your-path-to-lineicons/dist/lineicons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

You're all set to start utilizing Lineicons in your project:

```html
<i class="lni lni-add-file"></i>
```

### Using SVG as web-component

Instead of using icon fonts, you can also use SVG icons directly in your HTML. This allows for more flexibility, such as scaling, multi-color icons, and advanced CSS animations, while ensuring that the icons remain crisp and resolution-independent.

add the following script to your project

```html
<script type="module" src="/your-path-to-lineicons/dist/lineicons.js"></script>
```

You can now use the <svg-icon> custom element in your HTML to render any icon:

```html
<line-icon name="home" type="regular"></line-icon>
```

This approach provides the flexibility of scaling icons without losing quality.

### Using Icon Font CDN

One of the quickest ways to get started with Lineicons is by using the CDN. Lineicons offers CDN options for both free and premium plans.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.lineicons.com/5.0/lineicons.css" />
```
